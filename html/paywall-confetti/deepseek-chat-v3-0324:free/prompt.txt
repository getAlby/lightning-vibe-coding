Create a blank html page and display a bitcoin connect pay button in the middle which will request a payment of 1 satoshi from rolznz@getalby.com. Once the invoice is paid, show a confetti animation and set the preimage once the invoice is paid. Make sure to allow the user to pay either by connecting their wallet or paying externally (by polling the invoice). Do not modify the styling of the button in any way or add any text on the screen. Do not show any alert dialogs. Do not add any TODOs or "Optional" comments in the code.

Before you start, fetch the READMEs from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getAlby/bitcoin-connect/refs/heads/master/README.md and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getAlby/js-lightning-tools/refs/heads/master/README.md so you have the latest information (just read the output directly, don't save the files unless you fail to read the content). Make sure to only use the imports specified in the README, do not guess any new imports.
