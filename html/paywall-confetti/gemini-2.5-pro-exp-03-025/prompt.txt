Create a blank html page and display a bitcoin connect pay button in the middle. When clicked it should generate an invoice from rolznz@getalby.com for 1 satoshi using @getalby/lightning-tools. Once the invoice is paid, show some confetti. Make sure to handle external payments too.

Before you start, fetch the README from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getAlby/bitcoin-connect/refs/heads/master/README.md and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getAlby/js-lightning-tools/refs/heads/master/README.md so you have the latest information.
