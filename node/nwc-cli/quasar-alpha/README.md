# NWC CLI tool

This was created using VSCode Roo code plugin using quasar-alpha via OpenRouter.

[See the prompt](./prompt.txt)

The original prompt is good but seems like the model sometimes forgets some things, so just tell it again.

It had trouble with NWA.

Some minor human refinement was done afterwards.

To install open the app folder, then run:

```bash
  npm i
```

To run in interactive mode:

```bash
  npm start
```

or to run single commands:

- `npm start -- help`
- `npm start -- get_balance`
