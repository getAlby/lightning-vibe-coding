Make an NWC CLI tool.

it should have help and a login function where you paste a NWC string OR use a QR code to generate NWA QR code,
and also a logout function.

the NWC string should be stored in a file in the same directory but make sure there is a gitignore file so I don't actually commit it. If the user logs out the file should be removed.

If I start and the file exists it should automatically create the client which should be persisted for the entire app duration, unless the user logs out.

If the user logs out, also remove the NWC string from the file.

The CLI tool should have ALL the commands of the NWCCLient as well as subscription support and a way to exit out of subscribing.

It should support msat by default but also sats (e.g. make_invoice --amount 10000 or --amount_sat 10)

Make sure all commands support all possible parameters of the method.

make it a nice CLI tool with help for each command too. Use the commander library for this.

When I type npm start it should start the tool and show a welcome message that the user should login if they aren't already and tell them to use the help command for more info.

If I type npm start on its own, the app should keep running and I should be able to type multiple commands from within the app. (Support both single-command invocation AND interactive CLI shell.)

The interactive CLI shell should use the existing commander commands, but make sure that the commander commands do not kill the process after finishing.

To install use @getalby/sdk version 4.1.0 and make sure to add websocket-polyfill 0.0.3 as a dependency too.

After installing make sure to read the @getalby/sdk npm package so you understand how it works.

Build the app inside the node/nwc-cli-quasar-alpha/app directory.
